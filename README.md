 ## How SMS Works

 The Student Managemnt System (SMS) is composed of multiple layers in order to be fully functional.

 Uses Nextjs React as the front-end and back-end since it manages both the user interface and server-side API calls.
 
 Uses firebase for a consistent database to store user's data such as usernames, passwords, attendance, and grades.
